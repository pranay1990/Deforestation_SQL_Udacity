# Deforestation_SQL_Udacity
This is the project in SQL nanodegree program from Udacity

## Introduction
- _Understand which countries and regions around the world seem to have forests that have been shrinking in size_.
- _Which countries and regions have the most significant forest area both in terms of total area and % of total area_.

## Aim
Making informed and well motivated decisions with respect to making the biggest impact given the few resources available.

## Create View
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW forestation
AS
SELECT f.country_code AS forest_cc,
        f.country_name AS f_name,
        f.year AS f_year,
         f.forest_area_sqkm AS f_sq_km,
         l.total_area_sq_mi AS l_total_area_sq_mi,
         r.region AS r_region, r.income_group AS r_income_group,
          (f.forest_area_sqkm/(l.total_area_sq_mi*2.59))*100 AS perc_forest_area
  FROM forest_area f
  Join land_area l
  ON f.country_code = l.country_code
  JOIN regions r
  ON l.country_code = r.country_code
  WHERE f.year = l.year ORDER BY 1;
```

## Part 1: Global suituation

- _What was the total forest area (in sq km) of the world in 1990? Please keep in mind that you can use the country record denoted as "World" in the region table.?_

```sql
SELECT f.forest_area_sqkm
		FROM forest_area f
        WHERE f.country_name = 'World'
        	AND f.year = 1990;
```
